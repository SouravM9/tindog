# tindog
Tindog is a copy cat of Tinder, but only dogs are allowed. XD It is a guided project by Angela Yu, Owner of App Brewery following the course on Udemy on Full Stack Web Development. In this project, I have used Bootstrap and Advanced CSS. Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.
